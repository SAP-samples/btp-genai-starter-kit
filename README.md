# SAP BTP genAI starter kit

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/SAP-samples/btp-genai-starter-kit)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/SAP-samples/btp-genai-starter-kit)

## Description

This repo wants to give users of the SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) a quick way to learn how to use generative AI with BTP services.

## Requirements

- You have access to an SAP BTP global account or an existing SAP BTP sub account.
- `Visual Studio Code` is installed on your machine with the `Dev Container` extension. You understand purpose and basic concepts of [Dev Containers in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers).
- As prerequisite for using dev containers, `Docker` is installed on your machine and you understand its basics concepts.
- `Git` is available on your machine (test with `git --version`) and you know how to clone a project from github.
- The SAP BTP global account needs to be sufficiently entitled to use the following services and applications:

  | Name | Service/ Application | Plan |
  | --- | --- | --- | 
  | **AI Core** | `aicore` (service)| `extended` |
  | **AI Launchpad** (optional) | `ai-launchpad` (app subscription) | `standard` |
  | **HANA Cloud** | `hana-cloud` (service) | `hana` |
  | **HANA Cloud Tools** | `hana-cloud-tools` (app subscription) | `tools` |

## Download and Installation

### Step 1: Setup SAP BTP infrastructure

- Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine and open it in VS Code.
- Open the Dev Container on your machine from within VS Code (`Reopen in Dev Container`).
- Wait for the dev container to be built and the project to be loaded within it.
  >Be aware that opening the dev container can take a while! 
- In the folder [`config/secrets`](config/secrets) rename the file `btp_ai_setup.tfvars` to `my_btp_ai_setup.tfvars`.
    - adapt the value for `globalaccount` for the subaccount to be created within. You find in the global account landing page ("Subdomain: .....").
    - add your email address to the variable `admins`. This should be looking similar to this: `admins  = ["your.email@sap.com"]`.
    - save the file.
- In the folder [`config/secrets`](config/secrets) rename the file `btp_credentials.tfvars` to `my_btp_credentials.tfvars`.
    - adapt the value for the variable `BTP_USERNAME` to your email address.
    - save the file.
- Within VS Code open a terminal session. 
- In the terminal simply type `./run.sh` and enter your `BTP_PASSWORD` as well as the password for the `HANA DB` (you will be prompted accordingly).
  > Make sure that the password for the HANA DB matches the minimum requirements (length >= 8, 1+ upper case chars, 2+ lower case chars, 1+ digit)!

The startet script will now setup the following things for you in your SAP BTP global account:

- It creates a subaccount with the name configured in the `my_btp_ai_setup.tfvars` file (folder `config/secrets`).
- It creates service instances/subscriptions for the following services
    - SAP AI Core (service)
    - SAP HANA Cloud (service) with integrated vector engine
    - SAP HANA Cloud tools (app subscription)
- It creates a file called `.env` that will be copied into the [`config/secrets`](config/secrets) folder.


### Step 2: Deploy AI Models for your genAI experiments in AI Core

>The second step will automatically be taken care of by the running `./run.sh` command from step 1.
<br>After the successful setup of the BTP subaccount, it calls the python script `step02_fetch_metadata.py` in the folder [`scripts`](scripts).

That python script does the following:

- It loads the content of the newly created `.env` file from step 1 into the environment variables of the session.
- It calls the AI Core APIs to give you access to the models you have defined in the file [config/secrets/my_btp_ai_setup.tfvars](config/secrets/my_btp_ai_setup.tfvars) (through the variable `target_ai_core_model`).

### Step 3: Run GenAI examples

> After the steps above, you are all set for your first genAI experiments on SAP BTP.

You can proceed by switching to the folder [`scripts/step03_explore_examples`](scripts/step03_explore_examples).

Here you will find [some examples](scripts/step03_explore_examples/README.md) with respective instructions and sample code.

## Known Issues

> ‚ùóThere is an existing issue that makes AI Core API token invalid for about 1-2 hours after it was created. We implemented a retry mechanism, nevertheless, until the issue is resolved, running the `./run.sh` might result in the following error. 
As a temporary workaround, just re-run the `./run.sh` in 1-2 hours.
